notes about 6768 system
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

first, 6768 business flow was something like this:

    |<                MO                  >|<                         MT                            >|
	operator --> koin --> solegra middleware --> koin/crm --> solegra middleware --> koin --> operator
    |<                        DR                       >|
    
    - or it can be said that solegra only communicate with koin, operator only communicate with koin
	- thus made possible that solegra's API with koin merely using 1 API for MO, 1 for MT, 1 for DR, which handled all operator
	  or 3 php file for all operator (since koin communicate with solegra using url request)
	- this system already running on server mystique (application) and onslaught (database)
	
	
	
	
then do to migration (probably on march 2012), 6768 business flow changed into something like this:

    |<                MO                      >|<                MT               >|
	operator --> solegra middleware --> koin/crm --> solegra middleware --> operator
    |<                DR                      >|

	- or it can be said that operator only communicate with solegra
	- thus made previous system must be modified and solegra's API will be 1 for MO, 1 for MT, 1 for DR, for each operator
	  or 3 php file for each operator (some operator even require less do to some operator using SMPP to communicate with solegra)
	- this system about to or already running on server koin-gw (application) and koin-db (database)

changes on 6768 from old system into new system
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- API (in form of php files) having a lot of changes, mainly is to break-up 1 php file for all operator into 1 php file for each operator
  SO DO NOT COPY PHP FILES FROM OLD SYSTEM INTO THE NEW SYSTEM
- Application (in form of application file in C language) also having changes, specially in transmitter application, where in the application
  has beeen added to check message keyword to determine where the message should be transmitted (crm or koin or somewhere else)
  SO DO NOT COPY C APPLICATION FILE (OR XML CONFIGURATION FILE) FROM OLD SYSTEM INTO THE NEW SYSTEM

- BUT ALL APPLICATION USED (DISPATCHER AND TRANSMITTER) IS THE SAME (ONLY THE XML CONFIGURATION FILE THAT IS DIFFERENT)
  or in another word is that dispatcher for indosat is the same dispatcher application used for telkomsel, so is transmitter application
  
- The database also having changes from old system into new system, but the tables structure is still the same, the difference is that
  old system use 1 database for all operator, while the new system using 1 database for 1 operator
